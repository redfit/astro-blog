<Layout title='About'>
    <p>
        Hey, I&apos;m <b>Lazar Nikolov</b>. I live in Toronto, Canada, but
        originally I&apos;m from North Macedonia. As a fullstack engineer, I enjoy
        building interesting pet projects from scratch. Of course, just like any
        developer, I end up abandoning them. I&apos;m a super curious fellow and
        I&apos;m always up to learn something new. Aside from learning new things, I
        enjoy live streaming on Twitch and creating courses for egghead.io.
